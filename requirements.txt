# Core FastAPI and ASGI server
fastapi
uvicorn # For serving the application

# Database
asyncpg # PostgreSQL async driver
SQLAlchemy==2.0.30 # Core ORM
psycopg2-binary # PostgreSQL adapter, usually preferred over psycopg2 for direct installation

# Pydantic for data validation and settings management
pydantic==1.10.13 # Pydantic V2 core
pydantic-settings==0.1.1 # For settings management (BaseSettings)

# Password Hashing

python-jose==3.3.0 # For JWT creation and verification
cryptography==45.0.5 # Backend for python-jose

aiofiles==23.2.1 # For async file operations (if saving files async, otherwise remove)
python-dotenv==1.0.1 # For loading .env file locally
# email_validator==2.1.1 # If you use it for email format validation beyond Pydantic's EmailStr (often Pydantic handles this)

# File Uploads (for handling UploadFile content)
python-multipart==0.0.9 # Required by FastAPI for form-data parsing

# Utility
typing_extensions==4.14.1 # Often required by Pydantic/FastAPI for newer type hints
#uvloop==0.21.0 # Optional: Replaces default asyncio event loop for performance

# Optional: If you decide to use background tasks with Celery
# celery==5.3.6
# redis==5.0.4 # If using Redis as Celery broker/backend

# billiard==4.2.1

# Optional: If you have specific needs for rich console output in prod logs
# rich==14.0.0
# rich-toolkit==0.14.8 # Likely not needed for basic logging, mostly dev/CLI


# Removed (and why):
# alembic - migration tool, usually run as CLI, not a runtime dependency for the app itself
# annotated-types - dependency of Pydantic, usually installed automatically
# anyio - dependency of FastAPI/Starlette, installed automatically
# async-timeout - dependency of httpx/asyncpg, installed automatically
# certifi - common dependency, often installed by others
# cffi - dependency of bcrypt/cryptography, installed automatically
# click, click-didyoumean, click-plugins, click-repl, typer - CLI tools, not runtime deps
# dnspython - might be used by email_validator or other network tools, not directly in current code
# ecdsa, pyasn1, rsa - crypto deps, usually pulled by python-jose if needed
# h11, httpcore, httptools, httpx, idna, sniffio, urllib3 - HTTP client deps (httpx related), not directly runtime in app logic unless you make external HTTP calls
# iniconfig - pytest dependency
# Jinja2, MarkupSafe - Templating, not used in your current API
# loguru - You opted for Python's standard logging, so loguru isn't strictly needed
# Mako - Templating, not used
# markdown-it-py, mdurl, Pygments - Markdown parsing/syntax highlighting, not runtime deps
# orjson, ujson - Faster JSON, FastAPI can use them if installed but not strict requirements if you don't list
# packaging - often a dependency of other tools
# passlib - if not using its specific features (bcrypt directly used)
# pluggy - pytest dependency
# prompt_toolkit, wcwidth, shellingham - interactive console tools, not runtime deps
# pytest, pytest-asyncio - testing framework, not runtime deps
# python-dateutil - common datetime utility, often pulled by other deps, or not strictly needed
# psycopg - another PostgreSQL driver, redundant with asyncpg and psycopg2-binary
# websockets - for websocket servers, not used in current API
# watchfiles - for uvicorn --reload, not a runtime dep
